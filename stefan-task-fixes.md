module2
- split up into more tasks

- 1
  - but
  - no cms
  - form control?  input fields
  - no Body (I used Content, and still called it body)
- 2
  - for bit a bit oddly worded
  - missing . in type.id and type.name?
  - <option>'s start tag really confused me
  - order of select matters, shouldn't (Tom likely fixed)
- 3
  - url_for with admin.contents and type_name confused me
- 4
  - _POST_ed
  - from flask import Blueprint, render_template, abort, request !WORK
  - Allow _POST_ requests too
  - assert_right, \ tests/test_module2.py:169 does not print right error
  -  allow request.form.get('title')
- 5
  - `body
  - so,
